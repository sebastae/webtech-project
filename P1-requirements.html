        <h2>About us and our project</h2>
        <p>We are the group SÃ˜TAA, consisting of (insert names). Our client's name is (insert name), a distributor of seeds.
        <p>The purpose pf the site is to provide information about different types of flowers (that grows from the seeds sold by the distributor).
        <p>We will make the site by using a concept used by google; cards. That means, each flower will have a "card" assigned, which will provide some short info about it together with a picture. If a user clicks the picture, the user will be taken to a more descriptive page with more details about the selected flower.
        <p>Additionally, we will attempt to make this by using Json as a tool to reduce loading times and the amount of html needed.
        <p>Our target group is stores who sell seeds (and perhaps flowers as well), and those just interested in flowers in general. What they need is a simple overview of the different seeds they can buy, together with more detailed info if needed. They also need a simple way of contacting the company.
        <p>The sire will be structured with an index page, a gallery of the flowers, an "about" page, a contact page, and a dynamic page with info filled in with Json.
