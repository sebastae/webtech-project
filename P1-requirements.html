				  <h2>Our Client</h2>
				  <ul>
					  <li>Client name:</li>
					  <li>Type of company: Seed distributor</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>Our client's name is "Frøken - frødistributør AS". A distributor of seeds. <br> Frøken is a leading Norwegian seed distributor. For a number of years Frøken has used a vast amount of resources publishing a flora of all the seeds/flowers in its vast arsenal on paper, to send to all its partners and clients. In this digital age - the board of director has decided that this approach waste to much resources, and uses an amount of paper that do not sit in line with the companies otherwise green image. When the catalogue is distributed on paper, Frøken needs to send out extra materials to update the clients and partners with the always expanding arsenal of new exiting flowers based on trends and the never-ending game of gene modifying plants. </p>
				  <p>The board wants to digitize the proses of the flora and integrate it to the companies new website, ordered from SØTAA.</p>

				  <h2>About us and our project</h2>
					<p>We are the group SØTAA, consisting of Sebastian Ellefsen, Øystein Bjørkeng Haugen, Toralf Tokheim, Andreas Langnes and Adrian Sand. 
					<p>The purpose pf the site is to provide information about different types of seeds/flowers.
					<p>We will make the site by using a concept used by google; cards. That means, each flower will have a "card" assigned, which will provide some short info about it together with a picture. If a user clicks the picture, the user will be taken to a more descriptive page with more details about the selected flower.
					<p>Additionally, we will attempt to make this by using Json as a tool to reduce loading times and the amount of html needed.
					<p>Our target group is stores who sell seeds, flowers, and people in need of information about or is just interested in flowers in general. What they need is a simple overview of the different seeds they can buy, together with more detailed info if needed. They also need a simple way of contacting the company.
					<p>The sire will be structured with an index page, a gallery of the flowers, an "about" page, a contact page, and a dynamic page with info filled in with Json.
