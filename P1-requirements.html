					  <li>Client name: Frøken</li>
					  <li>Contact person: Fictional</li>
					  <li>Type of company: Seed distributor</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>Our client's name is "Frøken". A distributor of seeds. <br> Frøken is a leading Norwegian seed distributor. For a number of years Frøken has used a vast amount of resources publishing a flora of all the seeds/flowers in its vast arsenal on paper, to send to all its partners and clients. In this digital age - the board of director has decided that this approach waste to much resources, and uses an amount of paper that do not sit in line with the companies otherwise green image. When the catalogue is distributed on paper, Frøken needs to send out extra materials to update the clients and partners with the always expanding arsenal of new exiting flowers based on trends and the never-ending game of gene modifying plants. </p>
				  <p>The board wants to digitize the proses of the flora and integrate it to the companies new website, ordered from SØTAA.</p>

						<h2>A quick summary</h2>
				  </header>
				  
				  <p>We are the group SØTAA, consisting of Sebastian Ellefsen, Øystein Bjørkeng Haugen, Toralf Tokheim, Andreas Langnes and Adrian Sand. </p>
					<p>The purpose pf the site is to provide information about different types of seeds/flowers.</p>
					<p>We will make the site by using a concept used by google; cards. That means, each flower will have a "card" assigned, which will provide some short info about it together with a picture. If a user clicks the picture, the user will be taken to a more descriptive page with more details about the selected flower.</p>
					<p>Additionally, we will attempt to make this by using Json as a tool to reduce loading times and the amount of html needed.</p>
					<p>Our target group is stores who sell seeds, flowers, and people in need of information about or is just interested in flowers in general. What they need is a simple overview of the different seeds they can buy, together with more detailed info if needed. They also need a simple way of contacting the company.</p>
					<p>The sire will be structured with an index page, a gallery of the flowers, an "about" page, a contact page, and a dynamic page with info filled in with Json.</p>

						<h2>Audience</h2>
				  </header>
				  <p>The website has two main targets: <br> The first target is the partners and (potentials) clients using Frøken in their daily business. As a source of information and inspiration for the flowers themselves and not at least the information they need in their correspondence with Frøken. </p>
				  <p>The second target is people looking for good information and/or inspiration when it comes to the flowers themselves. They might try to identify a flower, or wonders how to treat it, so it grows.</p>

						<h2>Content of the Website and Organization</h2>
				  </header>
				  <p>The main structure of the page will contend of an index page (home), flora, about, and a contact page.</p>
				  <p>The home page the first page you get to when you visit the site. It is a brief overview of the company and a quick introduction of what to expect from the rest of the page. The company will have an opportunity to showcase its latest news and highlights.</p>
				  <p>As you continue in to the contacts page, you will find yourself viewing upon the two sets with contact information. The first is all the information you´ll ever need to get in touch with Føken´s sales team. But as end-users might be more interested in what shops Frøken distributes to, there will be a separate section showcasing the contact information for the shops.</p>
				  <p>Frøken has a proud legacy, and wants somewhere to show off who they are, and how they got there. This will be the “About” page. It will contain a history of the company. Its key achievements and the companies vision.</p>
				  <p>Lastly but not least, you´ll have the crown jewel: the flora itself. In this page, there will be an overview of the Frøken´s entire assortment of seeds, presented by flower cards. Each card will have a picture of the flower, and the base information. When the card is clicked, it will take you to a separate page where the extended information of the selected flower/seed.</p>
