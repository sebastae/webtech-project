        "text":"Oregano is a pungently aromatic plant that is one of the most important herbs of Italian, Greek and Mexican cooking. Mainly used dry, the flavor is strong enough to stand up to bold flavors like tomatoes, onion, garlic and beef. Interestingly, the oil is often a little known ingredient in men's colognes. A must-have herb for the kitchen, Oregano is readily established from herb seeds for the kitchen garden. The Oregano herb is a bushy perennial with attractive, deep purple-brown stems and 1 1/2 inch broadly ovate leaves that often have a red flush. Branched clusters of purple-pink flowers appear all summer. Grows to 18 inches tall and wide. <h3>Planting</h3> <br>Oregano can be planted from seeds or transplanted.  <br>It is best to start seeding indoors, and then transplant to your outside garden. <br>The seeds need light to germinate, so cover the seeds with only a thin layer of soil. <br>Oregano thrives in well-drained, a bit dry soil, with full sun. <br>The richness of the soil, the moisture of the soil, and general climate affects the taste of the herb. <h3>Care</h3> <br>The plants benefits from having their flowers pinched, this prevents bolting.  <br>Oregano plants gets most of their pruning from harvesting the sprigs.  <br>Covering the plants  branches of evergreen after the frost has set protects them from the wind.
