        "text":"Have you ever thought of growing artichoke plants in your vegetable garden? Artichokes plants are perennial flowers and members of the sunflower, or Compositae, family. Much of the artichoke plant is edible, but the portion generally eaten is the immature flower bud. The unopened bud has overlapping rows of spine-tipped green bracts enclosing the actual flower parts. At the base of the bud is the tender, flavorful artichoke \"heart\", which is the part that is cooked and eaten. <h3>Planting</h3> <br>Start the artichoke seeds indoors during late winter. <br>The plant thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil, with a good amount of composting organic matter. <br>Plant them outside before the weather has become too warm, as the plant needs slightly cold temperature before they will set buds.  <br>They need plenty of room, as they spread out to a large area.  <h3>Care</h3> <br>Keep the planting bed weed free.  <br>Add a thick layer of mulch, compost or wood chips, to suppress weed growth, and keep the roots cold and the soil moist.  <br>The plant needs periodic feeding, so fertilize every 2 to 3 weeks.
