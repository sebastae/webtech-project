        "text":"Violas comes in several different vivid colors. Violas look stunning with spring daffodils or as under plantings for roses and shrubs. Fill your containers and window boxes with these charming Viola flowers too! Viola seeds are rewarding to grow and the plants are hardy and tolerant of most soils. Sow the flower seeds indoors in late winter or outdoors early spring or late summer. <h3>Planting</h3> <br>Violas are quite easy to start from seed, and will after a while, start to self-seed. <br>They can both be seeded indoors, and then transplanted outdoors after about 4-6 weeks, or be seeded directly in your outdoor garden.  <br>Outdoors, they need well-drained soil, that has been loosened and moisted.  <br>Sprinkle the seeds in the loosened soil, cover with a thin layer of soil. <br>After the seedlings develop, thin the crop with 6 to 8 inches apart.  <h3>Care</h3> <br>Water often, but allow soil to dry out between waterings. <br>Violas need a bit of fertilizer during the growing faze.  <br>They tend to love the sun, but thrives in colder temperatures, so make sure they have shade during the hours in which the sun is at its warmest.   <br>Remove faded flower blooms to promote flowering period.
