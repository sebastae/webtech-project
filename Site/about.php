                FRØKEN has been a Norwegian Trondheim-based distributor of high quality seeds since the early 1800s. 
                Based on traditional values and methods, we strive to create the best seeds possible for ourselves, and our clients.
                The secret behind our high quality lies in the care provided for the seeds, and there are of course some in the processing.
                If you choose our product, you are guaranteed to get amongst the highest quality of seeds available, for your pleasure.
