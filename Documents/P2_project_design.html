As a source of information and inspiration for the flowers themselves and not at least the information they need in their correspondence with Frøken.</p>
					<p>The second target is people looking for good information and/or inspiration when it comes to the flowers themselves. They might try to identify a flower, or wonders how to treat it, so it grows.</p>

					The idea behind the visuals of the design are founded in keeping things simple and clean. This will lend to the goal of the client, which is to provide easy access to information to potential clients and buyers, as well as the casual user.
				</p>
                <p>
                  The decisions we made for the site layout were based on an idea of a modern, garden-themed webpage. Therefore, the background color is a modern white (#ffffff). Following the garden-theme we will use green colors to promote exactly that feeling. Links (not those in the navbar) and buttons will be colored in <span class="green_text">green</span> (#25CE13). We want to make the page easy on the eyes, that's why we will reduce the contrasts between content, and text will hence be in <span class="lightgray_text">light gray</span> (#95989A) for lighter text, and <span class="darker_gray_text">darker gray</span> (#444444) for darker text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Almost 6 million webpages cannot be wrong. That's why we will use Raleway as our elegant sans-serif font, directly from the Google API. To really make the content pop, we will use a 3px dropshadow with a 6px blur on relevant content (cards, buttons, footer, etc). Our navbar will be on the top of the page content (below the image slideshow on the index page). It will not be sticky, and it will have dropshadow on the bottom. The footer will be on the bottom, with dropshadow on the top. Buttons will as stated before be colored in green (#25CE13), and the text will be white (#ffffff).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As can be seen on the mockup, we will have a slideshow of relevant images with the company's logo in the front.
