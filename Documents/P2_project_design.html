                    <h4>Purpose</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of the site is to provide information about different types of seeds that the distributor offers, and the flowers that grow out of these seeds. It´s also supposed to be a mean to provide people whit the information they need in their daily business with Frøken.</p>
                    
					<h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>Our goal is to peak the users interest in the products Frøken provides, through a sleek and effective designed website. </p>
                    
					<h4>Audience</h4>
                    <p>The website has two main targets: <br>The first target is the partners and (potentials) clients using Frøken in their daily business. As a source of information and inspiration for the flowers themselves and not at least the information they need in their correspondence with Frøken.</p>
					<p>The second target is people looking for good information and/or inspiration when it comes to the flowers themselves. They might try to identify a flower, or wonders how to treat it, so it grows.</p>

                        Every page will have the same navbar, which will point to the main pages (Home, Gallery/Flora, About and Contact).
                        Besides that, the home page will feature three articles, and the Flora page will contain all articles.
                    </p>
					<p>
						One of the requirements set by Frøken is that the site should be fast and easy to navigate. To achieve this the page is given a structure making it possible to reach any page with a maximum of 3 clicks.

                        Page Layout and Appearance
                    </h3>
                </header>

					The idea behind the visuals of the design are founded in keeping things simple and clean. This will lend to the goal of the client, which is to provide easy access to information to potential clients and buyers, as well as the casual user.
				</p>
                <p>
                  The decisions we made for the site layout were based on an idea of a modern, garden-themed webpage. Therefore, the background color is a modern white (#ffffff). Following the garden-theme we will use green colors to promote exactly that feeling. Links (not those in the navbar) and buttons will be colored in <span class="green_text">green</span> (#25CE13). We want to make the page easy on the eyes, that's why we will reduce the contrasts between content, and text will hence be in <span class="lightgray_text">light gray</span> (#95989A) for lighter text, and <span class="darker_gray_text">darker gray</span> (#444444) for darker text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Almost 6 million webpages cannot be wrong. That's why we will use Raleway as our elegant sans-serif font, directly from the Google API. To really make the content pop, we will use a 3px dropshadow with a 6px blur on relevant content (cards, buttons, footer, etc). Our navbar will be on the top of the page content (below the image slideshow on the index page). It will not be sticky, and it will have dropshadow on the bottom. The footer will be on the bottom, with dropshadow on the top. Buttons will as stated before be colored in green (#25CE13), and the text will be white (#ffffff).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As can be seen on the mockup, we will have a slideshow of relevant images with the company's logo in the front.

                            The card based structure will give the user a good overview over navigation options without flooding the screen with text based information. The pictures on the cards will be a medium through which the user visually decide which flower they want further information on. By using a simple white background, the cards become a larger contrast, and draws the attention of the user.
                        </p>
						<p>
							As well as the photos, the cards will also contain a short text with information about the seeds/flowers. When a card is clicked upon, it will take the user to a separate page where one can see the extended information.
